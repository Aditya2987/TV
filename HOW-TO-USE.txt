📺 TV CHANNELS - HOW TO USE
=======================================

SUPER SIMPLE - JUST 2 STEPS:
-----------------------------

STEP 1: Select Channels on PC
   1. Double-click: start-server.bat (keep it running)
   2. Open: index.html in browser
   3. Select your favorite channels
   
STEP 2: Watch on TV
   1. Double-click: start-tv-server.bat (keep it running)
   2. It will show: "On your TV browser, open: http://192.168.x.x:3001"
   3. Open that URL in your TV browser
   4. Done! All channels work! 🎉


IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
✅ All channels (HTTP & HTTPS) work via HTTP server
✅ PC and TV must be on same WiFi
✅ Keep both server windows open while watching
✅ Works on any device browser (TV, phone, tablet)


TO ADD MORE CHANNELS:
---------------------
Just go back to Step 1, select more, then reload TV browser


FIREBASE HOSTING:
-----------------
If you want to deploy to Firebase (https://tv-channels-f64ae.web.app):
- Only HTTPS channels will work there
- HTTP channels only work via local server (start-tv-server.bat)
- Use: firebase deploy --only hosting
